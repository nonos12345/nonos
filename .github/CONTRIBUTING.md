# Contributing to `telegram.bot`

We are really grateful that you're reading this, it is because of the generous help from contributors that open source projects like this one can come to fruition.
To make participation as pleasant as possible, please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ebeneditos/telegram.bot/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Submitting changes

To ease the submit review, please take a look on our [coding conventions](CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-conventions) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit). In order to structure the feature development, we suggest to do the following:

1. **Fork the master main** repository [`ebeneditos/telegram.bot`](https://github.com/ebeneditos/telegram.bot).

2. **Create a branch** with an easy-to-identify name for the feature you want to develop (e.g. 'create-class-handler'). We recommend to make a different branch per feature.

3. **Develop the feature** and make the necessary tests to prove it works fine.

4. **Send a GitHub Pull Request** to [`telegram.bot`](https://github.com/ebeneditos/telegram.bot/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done. Always write a clear log message for your commits.

5. **Receive a sincere thanks!** If we have any doubts we will let you know.

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * For Telegram methods and variables, use [Telegram Bot API](http://core.telegram.org/bots/api) nomenclature.
  * In order to have a starting point for new classes, we are basing its structure and nomenclature on Python's submodule  [`telegram.ext`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/tree/master/telegram/ext) from
[`python-telegram-bot`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) library, so please take a look on it.
  * Set intuitive variable names.
  * Follow the structure of the already done work.
  * For coding style, follow [The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org).

Thanks ðŸ™‚
